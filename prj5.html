                    `This is a lightweight, modular supply chain dashboard to help an early-stage startup monitor inventory health during pilot rounds. The tool features live filtering by product and category, reorder point alerts, inventory value tracking, and interactive charts that visualize product distribution and stock trends. Designed with scalability in mind, it integrates with a SQLite backend and includes exportable reports for team-wide visibility.
                    <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> This is an anonymized version of a dashboard I built during my internship at a stealth-stage startup. In compliance with NDA, all data, branding, and product details have been replaced with placeholders but the logic and structure are identical to the version I implemented internally.`,
                    `Before building this dashboard, the startup was relying on a shared Excel sheet to manage inventory during early pilot rounds. While sufficient for the small team, this setup quickly revealed serious limitations as the business began scaling its operations. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every stock change, reorder check, and report had to entered manually</li>
                        <li>Multiple team members editing the same sheet caused version conflicts and accidental overwrites</li>
                        <li>As more SKUs were added, the spreadsheet became cluttered</li>
                        <li>Different versions of the same sheet were stored and sent across different inboxes and folders, which made organization inefficient</li>
                        <li>The Excel sheet didn't have historical data, making it hard to forecast and backtrack</li>
                        <br>
                        Together, these inefficiencies pointed to a need for a clear, automated dashboard to support the team as it scaled its operations

                        <li>Automatic alert that flags items below their reorder point</li>
                        <li>Product level filtering to allow members to filter by product name or category</li>
                        <li>Inventory value calculations (unit cost * quantity)</li>
                        <li>Downloadable reports for reports and sharing</li>
                        <li>Summary metrics to showcase total SKUs, total inventory value, and number of low stock items</li>
