                    `CLIP (Columbia's Learning & Information Platform) is the university’s first anonymous, peer-driven study material exchange. The platform enables Columbia and Barnard students to securely share notes, syllabi, past exams, study guides, and other academic resources all filtered by course and ranked by peer upvotes. CLIP enforces academic safeguards through strict access control (verified @columbia.edu / @barnard.edu emails), terms of service, and anonymous content reporting.
                    <br><br>
                    To incentivize high-quality contributions, CLIP uses a token-based system: students earn +2 tokens per upload and spend -1 token to unlock each file, creating a fair, contribution-driven content economy. Users can subscribe to specific courses to receive tailored uploads, making CLIP a centralized, high-signal academic resource hub powered by, and balanced by, the student body itself.`,
                    `<ul>
                        <li>Lack of centralized access to study materials</li>
                        <li>Same course number, different professor = completely different content</li>
                        <li>Preexisting note sharing platforms (like Coursehero) charge high fees for access</li>
                        <li>98% of students asked for user research prepare for exams using past exams and notes</li>
                        <li>Only 21% of students asked for user research have access to past study materials from upperclassmen friends</li>
                        <br>
                        After chatting with ~20 students from all grade levels, it became clear that accessing study materials is a campus-wide struggle. 98% rely on past exams and notes, yet only 21% have consistent sources. Existing platforms are fragmented by professor and saddled with high fees, which leaves the vast majority scrambling for accessible resources.
